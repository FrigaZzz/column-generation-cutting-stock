# Cutting Stock Optimization with Column Generation Heuristics

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of simple column generation heuristics to solve the Cutting Stock Optimization Problem, which is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The implementation is done using the PULP library in Python.

## Problem Description

The Cutting Stock Optimization Problem involves cutting raw materials into smaller pieces to fulfill orders, minimizing waste, and maximizing the utilization of resources. This problem is modeled as a MILP, where decisions involve selecting cutting patterns to meet demand while minimizing the total cost.
